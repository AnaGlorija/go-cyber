# Concepts

## Routes
The route is an energy route that routes Volts (changing cyberlinks bandwidth of destination) and Amperes (changing graph power of destination) to the given account.

The route is consists of a source, destination, value (volts and amperes), and alias.

Account or contract may only have fixed amount routes that adjust with the `MaxRoutes` parameter with network governance.

## Routing of Energy

- routing of volts will increase or decrease the bandwidth of the dedicated account
    - onboard new neurons to a network allowing creating of cyberlinks
    - adjust maximum cyberlinks rate of given dedicated account
    - adjust maximum cyberlinks rate of a given business
    - adjust maximum cyberlinks rate of a given community
- routing of amperes will increase or decrease graph power of dedicated account
    - onboard new neurons to a network allowing change ranks of knowledge graph
    - adjusting ranks of personal knowledge subgraph
    - adjusting ranks of business knowledge subgraph
    - adjusting ranks of community knowledge subgraph
- routing of volts and amperes will change your personal balance
    - routed volts and amperes will be sent to the `EnergyGrid` account
    - routed volts and amperes will be sent back to your account from the `EnergyGrid` account

## Graph Circuits
Graph circuit is a bundle of routes of a given account.
The circuit allows an agent to dynamically reflect and affect what is going on in the knowledge graph.
All agent's graph circuits are formed global network circuit.

## Energy Grid
Energy flows through the global network's circuit and forms a global energy grid.

## Accounting
While editing the route, you choose what value to SET, the target value of the route that you would like to be after messages will be applied. You will send tokens if you increase route value and will receive if decreasing.
